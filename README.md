# ðŸ¤– Luuno Robot

**Prepared by:** Jaime Rey  
**Major:** Computer / Software Engineering  
**Date:** July 30, 2025  

Luuno is a fully autonomous AI-powered robot designed and built from scratch, integrating advanced sensors, cameras, and custom software to perform complex navigation and interaction tasks without human intervention.  
This project demonstrates complete robotics system design: hardware, electronics, software, and real-world deployment.

## ðŸ’» Software Overview

### **Program 1 â€” Gesture + Face Tracking Control**
- Switches between gesture control and face-following using RealSense D455 and ZED 2i.
- Touchless control via hand gestures; follows recognized user in face mode.
- Real-time multi-threaded architecture for smooth operation.

### **Program 2 â€” Vision-Guided Target Tracking**
- Detects and approaches specific **ArUco markers** using ZED camera depth and RoboClaw motor control.
- Ideal for warehouse navigation and visual docking.

### **Program 3 â€” Precision Encoder & LIDAR Navigation**
- Executes precise turns, parking, and obstacle avoidance using LIDAR + encoders.
- Fully autonomous without requiring AI or heavy compute.

### **Program 4 â€” Hybrid Escape Navigation**
- Solves maze-like environments with hybrid sensing: LIDAR + ZED EXIT detection + encoders.
- Avoids loops, dynamically selects best path, and parks at exit.

Source code for all programs is in [`/code`](code).
